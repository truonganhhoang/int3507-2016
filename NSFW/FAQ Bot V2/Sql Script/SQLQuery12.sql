Shows File Explorer icon in the taskbar
Here are some noteworthy changes for Windows 10:

* OneDrive is now part of File Explorer. For a quick primer on how it works, check out [OneDrive on your PC](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17184).

* When File Explorer opens, you"ll land in Quick access. Your frequently used folders and recently used files are listed there, so you won"t have to dig through a series of folders to find them. Pin your favorite folders to Quick access to keep them close at hand. For more info, see [Pin](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=620936), [remove](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=620936), and [customize in Quick access](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=620936).

* Now, you can use apps to share files and photos right from File Explorer. Select the files you want to share, go to the Share tab, select the Share button, and then choose an app. For more info on sharing options, see [Share files in File Explorer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=623740).

If you"re coming from Windows 7, here are a couple more differences:

* My Computer is now called This PC, and it won’t show up on your desktop by default. To find out how to add This PC to your desktop or the Start menu, see [My Computer is now This PC](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=623739).
* Libraries won’t show up in File Explorer unless you want them to. To add them to the left pane, select the View tab > Navigation pane > Show libraries.',

'OneDrive is free online storage that comes with your Microsoft account. Save your files there and you"ll be able to get to them from any PC, tablet, or phone.

#The basics
To save a doc you"re working on to OneDrive, select a OneDrive folder from the list of save locations. To move files to OneDrive, open [File Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17217)and then drag them into a OneDrive folder.

#No Internet? No problem.
Files you save to OneDrive are available online at OneDrive.com and offline on your PC. That means you can use them anytime, even when you"re not connected to the Internet. When you reconnect, OneDrive updates the online versions with changes you made offline.

Offline files come in handy when you"re stuck without Wi-Fi, but they also take up space on your PC. If you"re running low on storage space, here"s how to keep fewer OneDrive files offline:

#Stay in sync

File Explorer icons show you the sync status of your offline folders and files.

*It"s in sync with online version.

*It"s getting in sync.

*The version on your PC is out of sync. To find out why, go to the right side of the taskbar, select the Show hidden icons  arrow, press and hold (or right-click) OneDrive OneDrive icon, and then select View sync problems.

#At the Office
