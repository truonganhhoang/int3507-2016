(1,'Windows Update Delivery Optimization: FAQ','How does Delivery Optimization work?',
'Delivery Optimization works in two ways.

* Download updates and apps from other PCs

In addition to downloading updates and apps from Microsoft, Windows will get updates and apps from other PCs that already have them. You can choose which PCs you get these updates from:

PCs on your local network. When Windows downloads an update or app, it will look for other PCs on your local network that have already downloaded the update or app using Delivery Optimization. Windows then downloads parts of the file from those PCs and parts of the file from Microsoft. Windows doesn’t download the entire file from one place. Instead, the download is broken down into smaller parts. Windows uses the fastest, most reliable download source for each part of the file.

PCs on your local network and PCs on the Internet. Windows uses the same process as when getting updates and apps from PCs on your local network, and also looks for PCs on the Internet that can be used as a source to download parts of updates and apps.

* Send updates and apps to other PCs

When Delivery Optimization is turned on, your PC sends parts of apps or updates that you’ve downloaded using Delivery Optimization to other PCs on your local network, or on the Internet, depending on your settings.',
'https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-windows-update-delivery-optimization'),
(1,'Windows Update Delivery Optimization: FAQ','How is my PC used to send apps and updates to other PCs?',
'Delivery Optimization downloads the same updates and apps that you get through Windows Update and the Windows Store. Delivery Optimization creates a local cache, and stores files that it has downloaded in that cache for a short period of time. Depending on your settings, Windows then send parts of those files to other PCs on your local network or PCs on the Internet that are downloading the same files.

Delivery Optimization can’t be used to download or send personal content.',
'https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-windows-update-delivery-optimization'),
(1,'Windows Update Delivery Optimization: FAQ','How do I turn Delivery Optimization off?',
'Here’s how:

2. On the Advanced options page, select Choose how updates are delivered, and then use the toggle to turn Delivery Optimization off. When turned off, you''ll still get updates and apps from Windows Update and from the Windows Store.

'https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-windows-update-delivery-optimization'),
(1,'Windows Update Delivery Optimization: FAQ','What security measures are used in Delivery Optimization?',
'Delivery Optimization uses the same security measures as Windows Update and the Windows Store.

Windows Update uses information obtained securely from Microsoft to validate the authenticity of files downloaded to your PC. Delivery Optimization also checks the authenticity of each part of an update or app that it downloads from other PCs before installing it.',
