If you have difficulty hearing your PC, Windows can help. Visual notifications let you receive visual warnings instead of sounds for system events, such as a new email message arriving. Built in closed caption options let you set preferences for how captions will look when turned on in an app.

# Use visual alternatives to sound
If hearing audible sound alerts is difficult, you can switch to visual alerts instead. Select the Start button, then select Settings > Ease of Access  > Other options . Under Visual notifications for sound, choose the visual response you want. You can choose to have the active window, active title bar, or the whole screen flash when a notification arrives instead of relying on sound alone.

# Adjust notification delay
By default, Windows notifications disappear five seconds after they appear. If you want more time to read them, increase the notification display time. Select the Start button, then select Settings  > Ease of Access  > Other options . Under Show notifications for, choose the time you want up to five minutes.Closed captioningWindows offers many options to customize things like the color, size and background of closed captions. Select the Start Start symbol button, then select Settings  > Ease of Access  > Closed captions , and then choose how you want captions to be displayed when you watch a movie or TV show.

There are various ways to make the mouse and keyboard easier to use if you have temporary or permanent issues with mobility.

There are custom settings available if you need help tracking the mouse pointer, or experience discomfort when using a mouse. To see them, select the Start button, then select Settings  > Ease of Access  > Mouse . Options include:Making the mouse more visible by changing the color and size of the mouse pointer.Controlling the movement of the mouse pointer with the numeric keypad using Mouse Keys.

# Make the keyboard easier to use
If you have difficulty or feel discomfort while using a keyboard, select the Start button, then select Settings  > Ease of Access  > Keyboard  to explore the following options:
* Sticky Keys can help if you have trouble pressing two keys at the same time. Sticky Keys let you press commands that use multiple keys (such as Ctrl + S) one key at a time.
* Use Filter Keys to set the sensitivity of the keyboard so it can ignore brief or repeated keystrokes.
* Instead of relying on the physical keyboard, try the On-Screen Keyboard. You select keys using the mouse or other pointing device (like a joystick), or you can use a single switch to cycle through the keys on the screen.

Note: You can also control your PC with just your voice using Windows Speech Recognition. To learn more, see [Use Speech Recognition](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17208/windows-10-use-speech-recognition)
